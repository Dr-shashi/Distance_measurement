## 📊 Features

- Fetches live road distances and durations using Google Distance Matrix API
- Sorts destinations based on **travel time**
- Creates a **color-coded Plotly bar chart** with distance/time annotations
- Saves output as both `.png` and interactive `.html` files

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Or manually upload all files to a GitHub repo.

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install requests plotly python-dotenv
````

---

## 🔑 API Key Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a project.
3. Enable:

   * **Distance Matrix API**: Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library" → search and enable **Distance Matrix API**
4. Navigate to:

   * "APIs & Services" → "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → **API key**
5. Copy your API key.

### ▶️ Use Your API Key

#### Option 1: Directly in the script (quick test)

In your Python file (e.g. `distance_plot.py`), replace:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

#### Option 2: Secure method using `.env` file (recommended)

1. Create a file named `.env` in the same folder:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```

2. Add this in your Python script:

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os
   load_dotenv()
   API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
   ```

3. Also add `.env` to `.gitignore` if using Git.
